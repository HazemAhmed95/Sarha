## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/HazemAhmed95/Sarha
```
```
composer install --prefer-dist
```
```
npm install
```

### Database setup

Edit `.env` according to your environment and save as `.env`..
An application key can be generates with the command `php artisan key:generate`.

Run these commands to create the tables within the database you have already created.

```
php artisan migrate:install
```
```
php artisan migrate:refresh
```

If you get an error like a `PDOException` try editing your `.env` file and change `DB_HOST=localhost` to `DB_HOST=127.0.0.1`. If that doesnâ€™t work, file an issue on GitHub, I will be glad to help.
